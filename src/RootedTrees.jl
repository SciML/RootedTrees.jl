    PartitionIterator(t::RootedTree)

Iterator over all partition forests and skeletons of the rooted tree `t`.
This is basically a pure iterator version of [`all_partitions`](@ref).
In particular, the partition forest may only be realized as an iterator.
Similar to [`RootedTreeIterator`](@ref), you should `copy` the iterates
if you want to store or modify them during the iteration since they may be
views to internal caches.
